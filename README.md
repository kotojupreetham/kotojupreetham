## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate **frontend developer** and **UI/UX enthusiast** from **Hyderabad, India**, obsessed with creating beautiful, interactive digital experiences that blend aesthetics with functionality. I specialize in crafting smooth animations, responsive designs, and performant web applications.

My journey in tech started with a fascination for how things work. Today, I spend my time:
- 💻 Mastering modern web technologies (React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS)
- 🎨 Experimenting with motion design and GSAP animations
- 📱 Building cross-platform mobile apps with Flutter
- 🔥 Leveraging Firebase for scalable backend solutions
- 🛠️ Contributing to open-source projects
- 🎯 Working on **FestFlow** — my passion project for event management

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new design trends, playing with creative coding, or jamming on side projects that push my skills to the limit.
